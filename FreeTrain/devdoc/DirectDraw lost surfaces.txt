HOW FREETRAIN HANDLES LOST DIRECTDRAW SURFACES
==============================================

Refer to MSDN for the background information about lost surfaces.

DETECTION
=========

DirectDraw.net library doesn't provide any means for detecting lost surfaces in an OO way. It just throws a COMException whose error code indicates that the error is due to a lost surface. This design is primarily because of a perceived (but groundless) performance penalty in setting up a try-catch block at every DirectDraw invocation. The application is expected to catch such an exception and do the recovery by itself.

FreeTrain does the recovery by setting up a try-catch block at the root of the drawing operation. One such place is at QuarterViewDrawer. In this way, we could save the number of try-catch overheads.

Once a lost surface is detected, it is required to trigger the PictureManager.onSurfaceLost event.


RECOVERY
========

Objects interested in being notified of a lost surface should register their event handler at the PictureManager.onSurfaceLost event.

The PictureManager object takes care of all the picture objects. QuarterViewDrawer does the right thing, too. So only those who directly manipulate DirectDraw surfaces are required to handle them.


TEST
====

To simulate surface lost, do the following procedure:

Run FreeTrain, then run another full-screen DirectDraw/Direct3D program. This will force FreeTrain to loose surfaces.
