All FreeTrain contributions have to have a unique ID. GUIDGen.exe is a tool
that generates such IDs. It needs the .NET framework to run, but if you're
already running FreeTrain, that should be enough.

When run, this tool will generate a new ID and copy it to the clipboard. If
you only need one ID, you don't have to press the copy button.

As any programmer will understand, this tool simply generates a GUID.
